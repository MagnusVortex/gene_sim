# Breeder configuration
# Breeders own creatures and select mating pairs
# Ownership rules:
# - Founders assigned evenly to breeders
# - Offspring inherit from female parent's breeder
# - Random ownership transfers occur (2-3 owners per creature on average)
# - Breeders give away all offspring unless parent nearing end (then keep one replacement)
